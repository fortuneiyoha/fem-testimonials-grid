## My process

### Technology used

This project was built using the following frontend technologies and methodologies:

- **Semantic HTML5 markup:** To provide a clear and meaningful structure to the content.
- **SASS:** To write CSS more efficiently with nested rules, variables, and mixins.
<!-- ! Fix 'bootstrap' description -->
- **Bootstrap:** A popular frontend framework that provides a set of pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components and styles. It helps developers create responsive and visually appealing websites with ease.

### What I learned

During the completion of this challenge, I learned how to utilize bootstrap's grid by enabling CSS grid classes `.grid` instead of `.row` classes. By utilizing Bootstrap, I was able to create the layout of the testimonials.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I will continue to utilize Bootstrap CSS grid to create layout ....
